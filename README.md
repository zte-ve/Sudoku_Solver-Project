# Sudoku_Solver-Project
simple fronnt end based Sudoku Solver Project based on backtracking algo
Here I have just created a simple sudoku solver web page using html, css and js.You can get a puzzle by getpuzzle and try to solve it by your own ,if stuck use the solve puzzle and see the answer.
Here, I did'ot want to use an api cause I was not getting one free of cost. So, I just created a solved suddoku first using backtracking and then removed some of the already filled blocks and showedit up on get puzzle and when I wanted to solve puzzle then I can simply show the already created puzzle.

**improvements:**
1. we can control the difficulty level by controlling the no of already filled blocks and categorize as easy , medium ,hard
2. we focus the already filled blocks to sublocks and making a uniform distribution , so that it becomes tough and interesting.
